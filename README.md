## Python program with Dynamic Linked Library(DLL)##

`ctypes` is external library of `Python`, which is able to call functions from dynamic linked library(DLL), also provides interface for `C` data types. By using `ctypes`, it is possible to expand a program beyond `Python`.

###Environment###

- CPU : Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6400 @ 2.7GHZ
- RAM : DDR3L 16GB PC3-12800
- [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/), [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/ctypes.html
